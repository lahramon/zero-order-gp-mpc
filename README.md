# Zero-Order GP-MPC

An efficient implementation of a tailored SQP method for learning-based model predictive control with ellipsoidal uncertainties,

- using the `acados` Python interface to solve the optimal control problems, and
- employing `PyTorch` to evaluate Gaussian process dynamics models with support for GPU acceleration,
- efficiently handling the optimization over the posterior covariances of the GP inside the optimizer,

by modifying the Jacobians inside the SQP loop directly.

## Background

This software is built upon the results of the article "Zero-Order Optimization for Gaussian Process-based Model Predictive Control", published in the ECC 2023 Special Issue of the European Journal of Control (EJC), available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0947358023000912. The code for the numerical experiments in the publication can be found [here](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ics/zero-order-gp-mpc).

## Installation instructions

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/lahramon/zero-order-gpmpc.git
    ```

2. Initialize submodules.
    ```bash
        git submodule update --recursive --init
    ```

3. Build the submodule `acados` according to the [installation instructions](https://docs.acados.org/installation/index.html).
    ```bash
        mkdir -p acados/build
        cd acados/build
        cmake -DACADOS_PYTHON=ON .. # do not forget the ".."
        make install -j4
    ```

4. Set up Python environment (Python version 3.9.13). In the following we use `pipenv`.    
    1. Change into main directory, then run
        ```bash
            pipenv install
        ```
    2. Export the variables `ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` point towards the right locations in your `acados` installation:
        ```bash
            export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR=<yourpath>/zero-order-gpmpc/acados
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<yourpath>/zero-order-gpmpc/acados/lib
        ```
        With `pipenv`, this can be done by defining a file called `.env` in the root directory, e.g., `<yourpath>/zero-order-gpmpc/.env`, which contains
        ```bash
            ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR=<yourpath>/zero-order-gpmpc/acados
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<yourpath>/zero-order-gpmpc/acados/lib
        ```

## Examples
